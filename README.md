# ctf_arm_re

CTF reverse engineering challenge for an ARM binary.

The challenge aims to show basic reverse engineering techniques and post-quantum cryptography recognition, understanding and implementation.

Prototyping is done on a Nucleo-64 dev board which features an STM32F103RB MCU. It has a ARM Cortex-M3 core and a built-in ST-LINK/V2 debugger/programmer.
